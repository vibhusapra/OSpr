# OSpr v0 progress

Started 2026-10-22, from an empty repository. Branch: `codex/ospr-v0`.

## Working implementation

- [x] Native SwiftUI Studio, History, Models, Dictionary, Modes, Settings,
  Research, menu bar and nonactivating recording HUD. Initial window visually
  inspected; final updated-build interactive QA is pending because the Mac locked.
- [x] Parakeet v3, native-layout Cohere 8-bit, Whisper Turbo/Small, Qwen3 ASR
  and Nemotron local MLX/Metal paths.
  Pinned weights/dependencies; bounded resident ASR plus optional refiner.
- [x] Toggle and push-to-talk shortcut, visual shortcut editor, microphone choice,
  bounded off-callback recording writes, waveform, duration, auto-stop option.
- [x] Captured-target AX insertion plus clipboard fallback, clipboard restoration,
  secure-field rejection, app/field/cursor revalidation.
- [x] Local history, edit/search/copy/delete/retention, raw/edited text separation,
  vocabulary, literal snippets, opt-in spoken punctuation and app modes.
- [x] Local optional refinement, separate BYOK audio/text routes, compatible,
  Anthropic and Ollama paths, Keychain storage, no silent cloud fallback.
- [x] File and sequential batch import, FFmpeg media fallback, TXT/JSON/SRT/VTT.
- [x] Cached Nemotron preview/finalization; rolling preview for other models.
- [x] Completed-take recovery through inference failure/restart. Private audio,
  retry/export/discard; retry never inserts into a stale app target.
- [x] Native CLI and optional stdio MCP with explicit file/text tools.
- [x] Persistent debug logs off by default; private worker audio cleanup, including
  next-use cleanup of orphan directories owned by dead workers.
- [x] Explicit model loading primes first-use kernels with synthetic audio,
  discarding the output; paired fresh-process warmup measurements retained.
- [x] Reviewed cancellation keeps recoverable takes, credentials write only when
  edited, old settings gain defaults, shortcuts retain their previous binding on
  conflict, and the menu bar can reopen a closed workspace.
- [x] Current official-source guide: 27 offerings, plans, feature comparison,
  43-item acceptance ledger, model strategy, ten optimization tracks, training plan.
- [x] Relocatable app bundle; all six engines passed offline after moving it to
  a path with spaces, from a temporary cwd and with an unrelated PYTHONPATH.
- [x] Portable app rechecked after capture/notes changes: six offline ASR engines,
  exact-source notes, speaker word attribution, clocked track mixing and MCP.
  Receipt includes the native executable hash and application build provenance.
  Bundled CLI/symlink discovery, poisoned PYTHONPATH/cwd isolation and signature
  validity after all inference/MCP calls also passed.
- [x] Apache 2.0 code license, attribution notice and macOS CI configuration.

## Verification and evidence

- [x] Native tests: 57 passed, covering text fidelity rules, Unicode snippets, retention/storage,
  provider endpoint restrictions, multipart/chat/Anthropic loopback contracts,
  30 concurrent worker requests, timeout/restart, audio frame integrity/overflow,
  secure-field early rejection and recovery store restart/corrupt-metadata cases.
- [x] Backend tests: 49 passed, covering normalization, invalid/media input, real AAC/FFmpeg decoding,
  silence without loading weights, stdio recovery, MCP boundary, Cohere layout
  adapter and streaming session fencing/packet bounds.
- [x] Real human audio: deterministic 200 test-clean / 165 test-other slices,
  73 speakers, plus 100 regression/stress cases and small five-language FLEURS set.
- [x] Persistent Metal whisper.cpp runtime baseline on the same English slices.
- [x] Cold/warm timings, raw hypotheses, versions, weights/corpus revisions,
  native IPC boundary, paired frontend ablation, RMS sweeps, cached packet replay,
  synthetic rewrite fidelity cases and seeded speaker-cluster bootstrap intervals.
- [x] HTML filters, benchmark rendering, feature-group interaction and desktop
  layout checked in the in-app browser. Narrow layout geometry fits without horizontal page overflow; first section visually checked.

## Release gates and remaining parity

- [ ] Final live microphone permissions, PTT/toggle, selected device, device loss,
  auto-stop, interruption and sustained-session checks on an unlocked Mac.
- [ ] Target app matrix: TextEdit, browser, editor, secure fields, moved cursor,
  clipboard restoration and selection editing. Current code/tests are not this QA.
- [ ] Native recovery retry/export/discard and incremental streaming walkthrough.
- [ ] Clean standalone installation, move/upgrade, signing/notarization and updater.
- [ ] Neural endpointing/VAD calibration, word alignment, deeper URL/app context.
- [x] Experimental speaker-labeled file imports with recognizer word timestamps;
  stitched-speech and natural AMI prefix measurements. Labels still need review.
- [x] Experimental ScreenCaptureKit desktop plus optional microphone capture, separate
  timestamped tracks, bounded writers, recoverable raw tracks and local FFmpeg mix.
  Physical capture/permissions and echo/device-route acceptance remain open.
- [x] Local extractive meeting notes: exact original quotations selected by a 4B
  model, validated source references/fingerprint, copyable Markdown and JSON history.
  Four synthetic coverage sentinels passed; natural relevance and context review remain.
- [ ] Improve diarization quality and evaluate complete abstractive summaries.
- [x] Watched-folder implementation, stability/deduplication/backoff/scanner tests;
  interactive folder selection and auto-export acceptance pending.
- [ ] Native webhook/automation destinations.
- [ ] Equivalent installed consumer-app benchmarks, correction effort and energy;
  broader speaker/accent/noise/spontaneous dictation and code-switching evaluation.
- [ ] Validate on lower-memory and older Apple Silicon hardware.
- [ ] Mobile/sync/LAN offload and enterprise administration are deferred tracks.

## Decisions from failed experiments

- The initial Swift-layout Cohere conversion lost utterances despite strict
  learned-weight coverage. Native-layout full-precision and 8-bit controls
  recovered them; the pinned native-layout 8-bit route passed the larger suites
  and is a new quality option. The legacy conversion remains research-only.
- Smaller Nemotron attention context increased compute without improving median
  first-partial audio position on twenty clips. Keep the model default.
- The 1.7B text model dropped substantive content. The 4B alternative still fails
  cases, including dictated prompt injection. Refinement defaults off; keep raw
  text and fail back conservatively. No guard is a semantic correctness proof.
- Small clean-English point-estimate gaps do not establish a model winner.
- No “top three” product ranking, full feature union parity, official leaderboard
  score, paid provider validation or battery-life result is claimed.

The machine-readable acceptance ledger is authoritative for feature status;
`research.html` is generated from that ledger and the raw measurement files.
